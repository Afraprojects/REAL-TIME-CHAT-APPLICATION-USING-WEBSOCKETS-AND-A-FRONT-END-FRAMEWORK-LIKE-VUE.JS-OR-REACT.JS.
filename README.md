descrption:As part of my internship, I developed a real-time chat application using WebSockets with a front-end framework like React.js or Vue.js. The application enables instant messaging between users with a responsive and user-friendly interface, ensuring seamless communication across devices. It includes features like message history retrieval, typing indicators, and read receipts, enhancing the user experience. The backend is built using Node.js with Express.js, while MongoDB or Firebase handles data storage. Socket.io is used to establish real-time, bidirectional communication between clients. This project deepened my understanding of real-time data transmission, state management, and scalable application architecture, providing hands-on experience in modern web development.
